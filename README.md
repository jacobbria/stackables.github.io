Hello!

Stackables is an indie game about progressively getting blocks stacked onto each other.
This website was made to give a basic understanding of the game and allow me to practice using the front-end basics (HTMl, CSS, JS).
Additionally, I made sure bring Bootstrap to get a working understanding of CSS libraries.
